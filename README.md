## Overview
- [Worldwide Travel Alert][application-link] is a simple _mobile-friendly_ web application for travellers to check if there are any alerts for their trips. 

- The alerts are retrieved from the [Government of Canada database][government-database-link]. 

- The features include:  
  - Updating the existing database.
  - Searching for alerts of a specific country in a region, subregion, or by a traveller.
  - Adding new alerts by traveller.

## Installation
- Clone the repo
- Install packages in both frontend and backend 

  ```bash
  cd backend/
  npm install
  cd ../frontend/
  npm install
  ```
- Build the frontend and copy it to the backend

  ```bash
  cd ../backend/
  npm run build:ui
  ```

- Start up the application

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- By default, the application is started at http://localhost:5000

## Notes
- Frontend is a React application created with [create-react-app][create-react-app-repo] package.
- UI is built with [Material UI framework][material-ui-website].
- Backend runs on [Node.js][nodejs-website] and is built with [Express.js][express-website].   
- Communication between frontend and backend uses [GraphQL][graphql-website] queries.
- A simple data validation is implemented in the input form to validate users' input data when they add new advisories.
